Thinking...
The user requests: "Write me a function to calculate fibonacci numbers". Likely they want a generic function. They might want iterative or recursive. They didn't specify language. Could be Python. I can provide Python function with optional memoization. Also show usage. Provide explanation.

Let's craft a response: function fibonacci(n) returns nth Fibonacci number, 0-indexed. Provide iterative and recursive. Also mention big integer handling.

Also maybe provide code for generating Fibonacci sequence up to n. Provide optional generator.

Ok produce.
...done thinking.

Below is a **single‑file, self‑contained** Python implementation that covers the most common ways to calculate Fibonacci numbers:

1. **Iterative** – fast, uses O(1) extra space.  
2. **Recursive with memoization** – elegant, still fast.  
3. **Generator** – stream the sequence without storing it all.

Feel free to copy‑paste into a file called `fibonacci.py`
